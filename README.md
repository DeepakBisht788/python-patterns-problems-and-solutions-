## Python patterns
This repository contains Python code for generating various patterns using loops. The patterns are designed to help understand and practice basic control flow (loops and conditionals) in Python. Each pattern is implemented using simple nested loops, and the output can be customized by changing the number of rows, columns, or other parameters.

## Patterns Included:-

1) **Rectangle Pattern:** Prints a solid rectangle of stars (*) based on the number of rows and columns.
2) **Hollow Rectangle Pattern:** A rectangle with stars on the border and spaces inside.
3) **Inverted Half Pyramid:** A pyramid shape with stars, but inverted (fewer stars in each row from top to bottom).
4) **Half Pyramid:** A right-side-up pyramid pattern where the number of stars increases with each row.
5) **Half Pyramid After 180Â° Rotation:** A pyramid pattern rotated by 180 degrees, aligned to the right.
6) **Half Pyramid Using Numbers:** A pyramid pattern where the row number is repeated for each row's elements.
7) **Floyd's Triangle:** A number triangle where numbers increase sequentially across rows.
8) **Butterfly Pattern:** A symmetric butterfly shape with stars.
9) **Inverted Pattern:** A pattern that prints decreasing sequences of numbers in each row.
10) **0-1 Pattern:** A triangular pattern that alternates between 0 and 1.
11) **Rhombus Pattern:** A rhombus-shaped pattern made of stars.
12) **Number Pattern:** A triangular number pattern that prints increasing numbers in each row.
13) **Palindromic Pattern:** A pattern where each row prints a palindromic sequence of numbers.
14) **Zig-Zag Pattern:** A zigzag pattern created with stars in alternating positions.
